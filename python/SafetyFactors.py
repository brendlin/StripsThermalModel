safetylayout = 0.0           # Safety factor on layout (number of channels,layers etc.)
safetyfluence = 0.5          # safety factor on fluence (calculations, machine predictions etc.)
safetythermalimpedance = 0.2 # Safety factor on thermal impedance of local support
safetycurrent = 0.2          # Safety factor on electrical power estimates
vbiasscale = 1.              # Scale factor for bias voltage (default is 500V)
