\section{Changes since the previous results}

{ \bf
The following adjustments were made to results since the version immediately following ITK Week in
November 2017:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The total analog current of the ABC is now set to 70 mA, based on the advice of Paul Keener.
(The ABC digital current is 42.5 mA.)
\item The ASIC-to-hybrid glue was updated to the ``UV cure glue'' described in the TDR. The previous
  glue used was tra-duct-2902.
\item The thermal conductivity of the PCB (powerboard) underneath the FEAST was changed from 0.3 to
3 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, based on measurements and advice from Graham Beck. The barrel and endcap FEAST
thermal impedance values calculated from FEA are now more compatible. The result is a reduced FEAST
temperature in the model.
\item The model now includes two AMACs on R3; previously only one AMAC was used.
\item A 1.9 mA quiescent current is included in the LDOs providing power to the AMACs.
\end{itemize}

{\bf 
The following adjustments were made since circulation of the document on December 12, 2017:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The flux estimates have been changed from ``Step 1.9'' to the ``step 2.2 duals layout'' used in
the Pixel TDR. This should be the latest flux estimate.
\item A bug was fixed in which the pessimistic TID bump parameterization safety factor was not applied.
This increases the maximum power estimates slightly, in the worst-case scenario.
\end{itemize}
