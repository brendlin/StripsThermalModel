\section{Changes since the previous results}

{ \bf
December 12, 2018: The following adjustments were made to results since the version immediately
following ITK Week in November 2017:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The total analog current of the ABC is now set to 70 mA, based on the advice of Paul Keener.
(The ABC digital current is 42.5 mA.)
\item The ASIC-to-hybrid glue was updated to the ``UV cure glue'' described in the TDR. The previous
  glue used was tra-duct-2902.
\item The thermal conductivity of the PCB (powerboard) underneath the FEAST was changed from 0.3 to
3 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, based on measurements and advice from Graham Beck. The barrel and endcap FEAST
thermal impedance values calculated from FEA are now more compatible. The result is a reduced FEAST
temperature in the model.
\item The model now includes two AMACs on R3 (powered by two LDOs); previously only one AMAC was used.
\item A 1.9 mA quiescent current is included in the LDOs providing power to the AMACs.
\end{itemize}

{\bf 
December 18, 2018: The following adjustments were made since circulation of the document on December 12, 2017:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The flux estimates have been changed from ``Step 1.9'' to the ``step 2.2 duals layout'' used in
the Pixel TDR. This should be the latest flux estimate.
\item A bug was fixed in which the pessimistic TID bump parameterization safety factor was not applied.
This increases the maximum power estimates slightly, in the worst-case scenario.
\end{itemize}

{ \bf
April 30, 2018: The following changes were made since December 18, 2018:}
% New system architecture: https://edms.cern.ch/ui/file/1807716/1.14/Full_System_Architecture_1.14_EDMS.pdf
\begin{itemize}
\item TODDO The FEAST is replaced by the BPOL12V, however the modeling of this converter (temperature
  and current dependence has not changed. The powering of the AMAC is now handled by the LINPOL12V
  instead of the BPOL12V (FEAST). This reduces the power associated to the FEAST, and thus the
  temperature.
\item The treatment of LV tape losses and FEAST voltages has now been made more consistent. Previously,
  tape resistances were modeled with a flat 10 m$\Omega$ resistance and FEAST voltages were set by hand.
  Now, the BPOL12V voltages are calculated on-the-fly using the voltage drop of the BPOL12V+tape of
  the previous modules. Currently the tape resistances are set by hand to force a 1V voltage decrease
  across the whole module. They should be updated with more realistic values. See Section~TODO.
\item Modules R3, R4 and R5 have been updated to include two HV filters and two HVMUXes. Details on the
implementation can be found in Section~\ref{highvoltage}.
\item New quantities have been added to the endcap model:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Round-trip LV voltage drop to/from PP2
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
